# 👋 Hi, I'm Lucas Negrello!

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a proactive, creative, and enthusiastic developer who always keeps my word. Everything I do, I strive to do well. I have a passion for architecture and am always seeking better ways to build my projects.

Autodidact and a lover of learning, I easily assimilate new content and never settle for just the basics—I like to understand the “why” and “how” behind things. I believe this deep curiosity is what leads to innovation: everything we use today was born from someone’s desire to solve a problem or improve what already existed. If something is good, maybe it can be even better!

I'm fluent in English (advanced) and Spanish (intermediate), and I thrive on turning challenges into opportunities to grow.

- 🎓 Degree in Systems Analysis and Development (Graduação)
- 🔧 Technical degree in Mechatronics
- 💼 Mid-level Developer (Desenvolvedor Pleno)
- 🏢 Currently working at PureCodeIT

## 🎸 Outside Coding

I'm eclectic and passionate about music—I've even had a band with original songs, where I was actively involved in songwriting! I love traveling, especially when it means being surrounded by nature, camping, or relaxing by rivers.
